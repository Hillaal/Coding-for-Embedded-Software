# Coding-for-Embedded-Software

This is the second chapter in my embedded systems track journey.  Here you can find my own implementations and solutions for the tasks that I had in college that include:

 - Some Drivers Implementations (e.g. DIO, GPT, PWM)
 - Some Design Patterns Implementations (e,g, Proxy, Poller, Observer, FSM )
 - Cooling controller Project (interfacing with TC72 Temperature sensor, PID controller, PWM driver)
 - Also some baby steps in RTOS
