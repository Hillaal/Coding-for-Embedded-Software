# Coding-for-Embedded-Software

This is the second chapter in my embedded systems track journey.  Here you can find my own implementations and solutions for the tasks that I had in college that include:

 - Some Drivers Implementations (e.g. DIO, GPT, PWM) for STM32F401xC microcontroller
 - Some Design Patterns Implementations (e,g, Proxy, Poller, Observer, FSM) using STM32F401xC microcontroller
 - Also some baby steps in RTOS (FreeRTOS, ATmega32)
